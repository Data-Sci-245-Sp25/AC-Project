In studying numbers of tobacco-related cancer deaths, far and away the largest number are lung cancer deaths related to smoking. These are followed by lymphatic or blood cancer, esophageal cancer, and lip/oral cavity/pharynx cancer. Lung cancer is a top result in the dataset as a whole, even before accounting for tobacco use.

The numbers of cases of the different types of tobacco-related cancers are all related to the health effects of smoking (American Cancer Society 2024). 

We then looked for possible demographic factors that could make certain groups more likely to have a tobacco related cancer death. We first considered veteran status to determine if veterans in Multnomah County are more likely to have a tobacco-related cancer death than non-veterans.

These results show that veterans in Multnomah County have a significantly higher rate of tobacco associated cancer deaths per year than non-veterans. This result isn’t surprising since veterans have a significantly higher rate of smoking compared to non-veterans nationwide (Brown 2010) (CDC 2018). While rates for veteran populations vary widely over this time period, there is no clear trend. The death rate for non-veterans is consistently at least 50 people lower than veteran rates.

For the next demographic we separated our dataset by sex. The data shows that men have a higher death rate of tobacco-related cancer than women.

These results are consistent with national trends as men generally have a slightly higher smoking rate than women (CDC 2024) (American Cancer Society 2024). The gap in rates seems to be mostly consistent over time with men having about a 10 deaths per 100,000 higher rate than women, though we see some variation. For example, in 2014 both groups had the same rate, around 22 deaths per 100,000.

The final demographic grouping for this study is by race. We grouped the data by the 7 races specified by the CDC codes plus a hand-constructed multiracial category.

These results are not consistent with national smoking rates by race. While it is hard to find other research that uses the same race categories, there are still many comparisons that can be made. First, some studies find that Black people have overall lower smoking rates than white people even when controlling for education level (Nguyen-Grozavu et al. 2020). This is not consistent with our findings. This may be indicative of systemic issues such as barriers of access to care or education.

This statistic is supported by an NIH study which found non-hispanic white people to have the highest smoking rates. This study goes further in documenting that these high smoking rates are found to be mostly with European ancestry. (Choquet et al. 2021). Another study by the CDC found that their “other non-hispanic” group had the highest smoking rates over white and black people. Our “other” racial group has consistently low rates compared to the other racial groups in our study. (CDC 2024). While many studies don’t specify race with a Pacific Islander category, the increasing trend of Pacific Islander death rates in our data set could be a cause for public health concern. 

The communities with the highest rates of tobacco-related cancer deaths in this study are Black, white, and Pacific islander populations. Our data shows a steady increase in Pacific islander populations over recent years. More information is needed to determine if this is due to a lifestyle shift in this population or if it is correlated with migration patterns into Multnomah County.

There are, however, some issues with the race data in our study. Many of the groups in the Multnomah County dataset observe 0 deaths for a given year. The Native American population reports 0 deaths for most years. This is likely because Multnomah County has a predominantly white population, so when narrowing the dataset to target the specific variables in this study, the sample size became quite small.
