    "text": "We used data provided by the Multnomah County Public Health office on deaths in the county for the years 2006-2023. Representatives from the county provided a research area for each group of students in the class. Our group studied tobacco-related cancer deaths.\nWe narrowed the dataset to specifically cancer deaths for the years 2014-2023 according to our main research question. Using ICD-10 codes, we grouped the data into recognizable types of cancers for study. The cancer-only dataset includes about 18,000 observations. Then, we narrowed down our dataset further using the data Multnomah County tracks about tobacco influence. We decided to include all observations where tobacco was a “yes” or “probably” related to the death, as any observation with a “probably” marker likely used tobacco. Thus, our dataset can be interpreted as “cancer deaths among probable tobacco users.” This targeted dataset has approximately 3,400 observations. Thus, this study focused on about 20% of the total cancer deaths in Multnomah County over the past 10 years.\nWe then accessed five-year American Community Surveys (ACS5) data through the tidycensus package to transform raw data into rates of deaths per 100,000 for ease of analysis. We chose to look at three demographic factors and their association with tobacco-related cancer deaths. The first was veteran status, reported as “yes”, “no”, and “unknown”. There were very few “unknown” observations. We used only the “yes” and “no” observations in context of tidycensus. Second, we considered sex, reported only as “female” and “male”. Finally, we considered race as a demographic factor. We referenced the CDC Appendix E Race Code list and transformed our data to match those categories, which are used in the tidycensus package. Individuals in the Multnomah County dataset are identified with up to 10 races. If an individual was reported to be two or more races, we assigned them “multiracial” for this category. Otherwise, we used the first and only reported race.\nWe compared the numbers of deaths in each category to the tidycensus ACS5 estimated population demographics for a given year. We divided the result by the estimated population and multiplied by 100,000 to get the death rate per 100,000 individuals. We use these statistics to analyze our data, compare county trends to national trends, and make recommendations for targeting health information towards specific populations moving forward.",

    "text": "In studying numbers of tobacco-related cancer deaths, far and away the largest number are lung cancer deaths related to smoking. These are followed by lymphatic or blood cancer, esophageal cancer, and lip/oral cavity/pharynx cancer. Lung cancer is a top result in the dataset as a whole, even before accounting for tobacco use.\nThe numbers of cases of the different types of tobacco-related cancers are all related to the health effects of smoking (American Cancer Society 2024). \nWe then looked for possible demographic factors that could make certain groups more likely to have a tobacco related cancer death. We first considered veteran status to determine if veterans in Multnomah County are more likely to have a tobacco-related cancer death than non-veterans.\nThese results show that veterans in Multnomah County have a significantly higher rate of tobacco associated cancer deaths per year than non-veterans. This result isn’t surprising since veterans have a significantly higher rate of smoking compared to non-veterans nationwide (Brown 2010) (CDC 2018). While rates for veteran populations vary widely over this time period, there is no clear trend. The death rate for non-veterans is consistently at least 50 people lower than veteran rates.\nFor the next demographic we separated our dataset by sex. The data shows that men have a higher death rate of tobacco-related cancer than women.\nThese results are consistent with national trends as men generally have a slightly higher smoking rate than women (CDC 2024) (American Cancer Society 2024). The gap in rates seems to be mostly consistent over time with men having about a 10 deaths per 100,000 higher rate than women, though we see some variation. For example, in 2014 both groups had the same rate, around 22 deaths per 100,000.\nThe final demographic grouping for this study is by race. We grouped the data by the 7 races specified by the CDC codes plus a hand-constructed multiracial category.\nThese results are not consistent with national smoking rates by race. While it is hard to find other research that uses the same race categories, there are still many comparisons that can be made. First, some studies find that Black people have overall lower smoking rates than white people even when controlling for education level (Nguyen-Grozavu et al. 2020). This is not consistent with our findings. This may be indicative of systemic issues such as barriers of access to care or education.\nThis statistic is supported by an NIH study which found non-hispanic white people to have the highest smoking rates. This study goes further in documenting that these high smoking rates are found to be mostly with European ancestry. (Choquet et al. 2021). Another study by the CDC found that their “other non-hispanic” group had the highest smoking rates over white and black people. Our “other” racial group has consistently low rates compared to the other racial groups in our study. (CDC 2024). While many studies don’t specify race with a Pacific Islander category, the increasing trend of Pacific Islander death rates in our data set could be a cause for public health concern. \nThe communities with the highest rates of tobacco-related cancer deaths in this study are Black, white, and Pacific islander populations. Our data shows a steady increase in Pacific islander populations over recent years. More information is needed to determine if this is due to a lifestyle shift in this population or if it is correlated with migration patterns into Multnomah County.\nThere are, however, some issues with the race data in our study. Many of the groups in the Multnomah County dataset observe 0 deaths for a given year. The Native American population reports 0 deaths for most years. This is likely because Multnomah County has a predominantly white population, so when narrowing the dataset to target the specific variables in this study, the sample size became quite small.",

    "text": "The top tobacco-related fatal cancer type in Multnomah County is by far lung cancer, followed by other smoking-related cancers. These cancers are preventable with changes in lifestyle choices and targeting education efforts towards at-risk populations could lead to decreases in rates of these types of cancer deaths.\nVeterans are at a much higher risk than non-veterans. This could mean that targeted anti-smoking information campaigns could be especially effective in places like the VA hospital as it is a place which veterans specifically congregate to and is already providing health services. \nWhile there is a noticeable difference between men and women for tobacco-related cancer deaths, the difference is small in comparison to other demographic groups. Focusing efforts on more at risk populations is likely more effective than targeting men over women. This gender gap could also be somewhat targeted by targeting veterans as more than 80% of veterans are men (DOD 2025). \nAnother community that the public health department should consider targeting information campaigns to are Pacific Islander communities as their tobacco-related cancer death rates are steadily rising in Multnomah County. Further research should be done in an effort to narrow down vulnerable neighborhoods so health information can be provided at community events.\nThis study is limited by a lack of information on some of the smaller groups studied, such as the racial groups which are not as present in Multnomah County as white people are. Further research should focus on understanding cultural and social reasons why certain groups are found to be at higher risk and how to best address sociopolitical inequities driving these statistics.",

    "text": "About 1 in 4 cancer deaths worldwide and 1 in 3 cancer deaths in America can be associated with tobacco use and tobacco is the largest portion of all lifestyle attributed cancers (American Cancer Society 2024) (CDC 2025).  With cancer being the leading cause of death in the US, any efforts to prevent lifestyle related cancer diagnoses is imperative for improving public health. This means that anti-smoking campaigns have the most potential for preventing cancer deaths as tobacco use is the highest proportion of lifestyle related cancer diagnoses (American Cancer Society 2024). Tobacco use causes about 440,000 premature cancer deaths in the US alone (National Library of Medicine 1970). It is also a leading cause of all environmentally caused cancer in America (Anand et al. 2008).",
